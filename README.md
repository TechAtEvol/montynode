# Montynode
A Monty Hall demo.
When using the API to play game round, the system simulates that the player selects the first lake in the first game and when the game host presents which lake Nessie not is hiding in, besides the selected lake - the player switches to another lake.  
Repeated play presents statistics that supports if switching is better than staying over time.
